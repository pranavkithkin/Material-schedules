# Manual Testing Guide - Basic CRUD Operations

## üéØ Purpose

This guide helps you test all basic features of the Material Delivery Dashboard **without AI features**. Everything will be entered manually to verify the core functionality works perfectly.

---

## ‚úÖ Pre-Testing Checklist

Before starting manual testing:

- [ ] Database is initialized (`python init_db.py`)
- [ ] Flask app starts without errors
- [ ] All migrations are applied
- [ ] No console errors in browser
- [ ] Forms load correctly

---

## üß™ Automated Test Suite

### Run All Basic CRUD Tests

**In WSL:**
```bash
cd "/mnt/c/Users/PKP/Documents/PRANAV/Projects/With a clear picture/9. material delivery dashboard"
source venv/bin/activate
pytest tests/test_basic_crud_manual.py -v
```

**Or use the test runner:**
```bash
wsl bash tests/run_basic_tests.sh
```

### Test Coverage

The automated tests verify:
- ‚úÖ All CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- ‚úÖ Data relationships between models
- ‚úÖ Attribute consistency
- ‚úÖ Status transitions
- ‚úÖ Validation rules
- ‚úÖ Complete workflow integration
