# Today's Accomplishments - October 4, 2025

## 🎯 Mission: Simplify Field Structure for Real-World PO Tracking

**Problem Identified:**
> "PO is not a single item. For sanitary wares there are almost 50 different items like shower head, shower mixer, mixer, WC, shattaf, etc. We are only considering the outer [envelope]. What's inside must be only partially covered."

**Solution Implemented:**
Remove item-level quantity/unit tracking from all forms. Focus on completion percentages and document uploads as source of truth.

## 💡 Key Decisions Made

### 1. Why Remove Quantity Fields?
**Problem**: PO-2025-001 has 50 different items with different units
**Solution**: Track completion percentage, document contains item details
**Benefit**: Scalable to any PO complexity

### 2. Why Payment Terms Display?
**Problem**: Users need to check PO to see payment terms
**Solution**: Auto-display from PO when selected
**Benefit**: Convenient reference, enables reminder logic

### 3. Why Revision Numbers?
**Problem**: Material submittals get revised, history lost
**Solution**: New record for each revision, linked to previous
**Benefit**: Audit trail, compliance, history preservation

### 4. Why Delivery Percentage?
**Problem**: "30 units delivered" - which 30 of 50 items?
**Solution**: Overall completion percentage (e.g., 65%)
**Benefit**: Clear progress indicator, visual progress bar

### 5. Why Document-Centric?
**Problem**: Manual entry of 50 items is error-prone
**Solution**: Upload Delivery Order, AI extracts details (Sprint 2)
**Benefit**: Accurate, efficient, enables chatbot queries

## 🎓 Lessons Learned

### 1. Match Reality, Not Theory
- ❌ Theoretical model: One PO = One Item with Quantity
- ✅ Reality: One PO = 50+ Items with Various Units
- **Learning**: Always validate data model against real-world usage

### 2. Document as Source of Truth
- ❌ Manual data entry for every item
- ✅ Upload document, AI extracts when needed
- **Learning**: Leverage documents, reduce manual work

### 3. Progress Over Precision
- ❌ Exact item counts (complex, error-prone)
- ✅ Percentage completion (simple, clear)
- **Learning**: Sometimes approximate is better than precisely wrong

### 4. User Experience Matters
- ❌ Confusing fields ("Quantity for payment?")
- ✅ Meaningful fields ("Full or Partial payment?")
- **Learning**: Field labels should match user mental model

### 5. Future-Proofing
- ❌ Quick fix for current problem
- ✅ Structure ready for AI document extraction
- **Learning**: Think 2 sprints ahead when designing schema
