# Field Structure Update - October 4, 2025

## Overview
Updated the database schema and all forms to reflect the simplified tracking approach:
- **Payments**: Focus on payment completion (Full/Partial), not item quantities
- **Materials**: Track submittal revisions, not individual item quantities
- **Deliveries**: Track completion percentage with document upload, not item-level quantities

---

## Database Changes

### ✅ Database Initialized Successfully
- All tables created with new field structure
- Database location: `instance/delivery_dashboard.db`
- Migration completed: October 4, 2025

### 1. **Payment Model** (payments table)
**Added Fields:**
- `payment_terms` (TEXT) - Payment terms from PO reference
- `payment_status` (VARCHAR 50) - Full/Partial/Pending/Cancelled

**Removed Fields:**
- ❌ `quantity` - Not applicable to payments
- ❌ `unit` - Not applicable to payments

**Purpose:**
- Track whether payment is full or partial
- Display payment terms from PO for reference
- Reminder logic: Alert if partial payment made and balance due before delivery

### 2. **Material Model** (materials table)
**Added Fields:**
- `revision_number` (INTEGER, default 0) - Track submittal revisions (Rev 0, Rev 1, Rev 2...)
- `previous_submittal_id` (INTEGER) - Foreign key to materials.id, links revision history
- `document_path` (VARCHAR 500) - Store submittal documents

**Removed Fields:**
- ❌ `quantity` - Tracked at PO level, not material type level
- ❌ `unit` - Tracked at PO level

**Purpose:**
- Track submittal revision history (single or double approved submittals)
- Link resubmissions to previous versions
- Most materials have single submittal, some have multiple revisions
- Final approved submittal covers all materials in scope

**Revision Workflow:**
1. Initial submittal → Rev 0
2. If "Revise & Resubmit" → New entry with Rev 1, linked to Rev 0
3. History preserved for audit trail

### 3. **Delivery Model** (deliveries table)
**Added Fields:**
- `delivery_percentage` (FLOAT, default 0) - For partial deliveries (e.g., 65%)
- Existing: `delivery_note_path` (VARCHAR 500) - Store delivery order documents

**Updated Field:**
- `delivery_status` options changed to:
  - **Pending** - Not yet delivered
  - **Partial** - Partially delivered (with percentage + document)
  - **Delivered** - Fully delivered (with document)
  - **Rejected** - Rejected or returned

**Removed Fields:**
- ❌ `ordered_quantity` - PO can have 50+ items, tracked externally
- ❌ `delivered_quantity` - Document contains details
- ❌ `unit` - Multiple units per PO

**Purpose:**
- Track delivery completion at PO level (outer envelope)
- Delivery Order document upload = final proof
- Percentage for partial deliveries
- Item-level details in uploaded Delivery Order document
- Future: Chatbot will read delivery note to answer "Is material X delivered?"

- ✅ Add previous_submittal_id for linking revisions
- ✅ Validation updated to work with new fields

**Workflow:**
1. New material → Rev 0, no previous submittal
2. Resubmission → Increment revision, select previous submittal from dropdown
3. History preserved for tracking double submittals
4. Final approved version represents all materials

### 3. **Deliveries Form** (`templates/deliveries.html`)

**UI Changes:**

## API/Backend Updates

### 1. **Models Updated** ✅
- `models/payment.py` - Added payment_terms, payment_status
- `models/material.py` - Added revision_number, previous_submittal_id, document_path
- `models/delivery.py` - Added delivery_percentage

### 2. **Validation Logic** (Future Enhancement)
- Payment reminder logic: Check if partial + balance due before delivery date
- Material revision validation: Ensure previous_submittal_id exists if revision > 0
- Delivery percentage validation: Must be 0-100, required for Partial status

### 3. **Data Processing Agent** (Sprint 1)
- Already handles all record types (lpo_release, invoice, delivery, submittal)
- No changes needed for field structure update
- Validation continues to work with new field names

## Data Migration Notes

**Good News:** Database was empty, so no data migration needed!

**If you had existing data:**
- SQLite doesn't support DROP COLUMN
- Old columns would remain but be ignored by updated models
- For clean schema: Export data → Drop tables → Recreate → Import data

**Current Status:**
- Fresh database with correct structure
- All new fields present
- Ready for production use

---

## Future Enhancements (Sprint 2+)

### 1. **Payment Reminders**
```python
def check_payment_reminders():
    # If payment_status = 'Partial'
    # AND PO.delivery_date approaching
    # AND balance remaining
    # THEN send reminder
```

### 2. **Material Revision Management**
- UI to view revision history
- Compare revisions side-by-side
- Auto-increment revision number on resubmit
- Link resubmissions to previous versions

### 3. **Delivery Document Intelligence** (Chatbot)
- Upload Delivery Order PDF
- Extract delivered items and quantities
- Answer: "Is [material] delivered?"
- Cross-reference with PO items
- Verify quantities match

### 4. **Percentage Auto-Update**
- When delivery document uploaded
- Extract delivered items
- Calculate percentage against PO total
- Auto-update delivery_percentage field
