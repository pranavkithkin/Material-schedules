# 🚨 CRITICAL FIX: Payment Over-Limit Validation

## ❌ **Bug Found:**

You correctly identified a **critical financial bug**! The system was allowing payments that **exceed the Purchase Order amount**.

### Example of the Bug:
```
PO-2025-001: AED 15,000.00

Payments Made:
- Payment 1: AED 12,000.00 ✅ Allowed
- Payment 2: AED 15,000.00 ✅ Allowed (SHOULD BE BLOCKED!)

Total Payments: AED 27,000.00
PO Amount:      AED 15,000.00
Over-payment:   AED 12,000.00 ❌ FINANCIAL ERROR!
```

---

## ✅ **Fix Applied:**

### New Validation Logic:

The system now **checks total payments against PO amount** before allowing any new payment:

```python
def _validate_payment_against_po(po_id, new_payment_amount):
    1. Get Purchase Order details
    2. Get ALL existing payments for this PO
    3. Calculate: Total Existing Payments
    4. Calculate: Total with New Payment
    5. Check if exceeds PO amount
    
    IF total > PO amount:
        ❌ BLOCK with error message
    ELIF total > 95% of PO:
        ⚠️ WARN user (close to limit)
    ELSE:
        ℹ️ SHOW payment progress
```

## 📋 **Code Changes:**

### File: `services/data_processing_agent.py`

#### 1. Updated `_validate_invoice()`:
```python
# Added this line:
if data.get('po_id') and data.get('total_amount'):
    self._validate_payment_against_po(data['po_id'], data['total_amount'])
```

#### 2. New Method `_validate_payment_against_po()`:
```python
def _validate_payment_against_po(self, po_id: int, new_payment_amount: float):
    """
    CRITICAL: Validate that total payments don't exceed PO amount.
    Prevents over-payment and financial errors.
    """
    # Get PO
    # Get existing payments
    # Calculate totals
    # Check limits
    # Block/Warn/Allow
```

### Financial Protection:
```
Average PO: AED 50,000

- **New payments**: Full validation + check
- **Edited payments**: Not yet implemented (future enhancement)

### 3. Multiple Currencies
- Currently assumes all in AED
- Future: Handle multi-currency POs
