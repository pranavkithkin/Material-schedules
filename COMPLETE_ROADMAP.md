   - If <60%: Send clarification request to sender

Include:
- Error handling for unreadable files
- Notification templates
- Webhook for real-time processing
- Complete workflow JSON export"
```

#### Step 1B.5: API Endpoints for AI Agent
**What to ask Claude:**
```
"Create these new API endpoints in routes/ai_agent.py:

POST /api/ai-agent/process-document
- Input: file (PDF/image), source (email/upload/whatsapp), metadata
- Output: extracted_data, confidence, missing_fields, clarification_questions
- Process: OCR/extract text → AI analysis → Return structured data

POST /api/ai-agent/chat
- Input: message, conversation_id (for context)
- Output: response, action (if any), extracted_data

### PHASE 5: Email Monitor Workflow (OPTIONAL - Final Phase)
**Goal:** Automated email parsing for unstructured supplier communications

**Note:** This is moved to the end because emails are often unstructured and parsing them requires significant effort for limited value. Prioritize manual upload + AI extraction first.

#### Step 5.1: Email Monitoring Setup
**What to ask Claude:**
```
"Create n8n workflow for email monitoring:
1. IMAP Email Trigger - Monitor inbox every 30 minutes
2. Filter emails - Keywords: PO, Purchase Order, Delivery, Invoice
3. Extract email body + attachments (PDF)
4. HTTP Request to Claude API:
   Prompt: 'Extract from this email: PO number, material name, delivery date, 
            supplier name, amount. Return JSON with confidence score.
            If unclear, set low confidence.'
5. Parse Claude response
6. POST to /api/n8n/ai-suggestion
7. Notification based on confidence:
   - High (≥90%): Success notification
   - Medium (60-89%): Review needed
   - Low (<60%): Ignore or flag

Include:
- Error handling for email parsing failures
- Attachment handling (PDF/images only)
- Spam/irrelevant email filtering
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Complete workflow JSON export"
```

**Why This is Last:**
- Emails are often unstructured (casual language, incomplete info)
- Low accuracy compared to manual PDF upload
- Requires extensive prompt engineering
- Better to focus on structured data entry first
- Can always add later if email quality improves

**✅ Deliverable:** Email monitoring (only if needed after core features work well)
