AI: 'Got it! I'll create a PO. What's the PO number?'
User: 'PO-5678'
AI: 'When do you expect delivery?'
User: 'Next Monday'
AI: '✅ Created PO-5678 for Steel:
     - Supplier: XYZ
     - Quantity: 50 tons
     - Amount: AED 80,000
     - Expected: 2025-10-07

   Body: {
     file: base64_encoded_attachment,
     source: 'email',
     metadata: {sender, subject, date}
   }
5. AI processes document → Returns extracted data + confidence
6. Decision Node:
   - If confidence ≥90%: Auto-create PO + Send success notification
   - If 60-89%: Send 'Review Needed' email/WhatsApp
   - If <60%: Send clarification request to sender

Include:
- Error handling for unreadable files
- Notification templates
- Webhook for real-time processing
- Complete workflow JSON export"
```

#### Step 1B.5: API Endpoints for AI Agent ✅

```
"Create these new API endpoints in routes/ai_agent.py:

POST /api/ai-agent/process-document
- Input: file (PDF/image), source (email/upload/whatsapp), metadata
- Output: extracted_data, confidence, missing_fields, clarification_questions
- Process: OCR/extract text → AI analysis → Return structured data

POST /api/ai-agent/chat
- Input: message, conversation_id (for context)
- Output: response, action (if any), extracted_data
- Process: Understand intent → Query DB if needed → Conversational response

POST /api/ai-agent/clarify

### PHASE 7: Advanced Analytics & Predictions (Week 7) 🔄 IN PROGRESS
**Goal:** Business intelligence, predictions, and advanced features

#### Step 6.1: Analytics Dashboard ⏳ NEXT
**What to ask Claude:**
```
"Create analytics dashboard with:
1. Supplier Performance Metrics:
   - On-time delivery rate by supplier
   - Average delay by supplier
   - Total order value by supplier
   - Quality/reliability scores

2. Delivery Timeline Analysis:
   - Delivery trends over time (chart)
   - Average lead time by material type
   - Delays by month/week
   - Upcoming deliveries calendar

3. Payment Analysis:
   - Payment completion percentage
   - Outstanding payments by supplier
   - Payment timeline vs delivery timeline
   - Cash flow projections

4. Material Analysis:
   - Most/least ordered materials
   - Material approval timeline
   - Stock status trends

Include:
- Interactive charts (Chart.js or Plotly)
- Filters (date range, supplier, material type)
- Export to Excel/PDF
- Drill-down capabilities

Files:
- routes/analytics.py
- services/analytics_service.py
- templates/analytics.html
"
```

#### Step 5.2: Confidence Tuning ⏳
**What to ask Claude:**
```
"Create admin settings page:
- Adjust confidence thresholds (auto-update, review-needed, discard)
- View AI accuracy over time (approved vs rejected suggestions)
- Retrain prompts based on feedback
- Test AI extraction with sample documents"
```

#### Step 5.3: Predictive Alerts ⏳
**What to ask Claude:**
```
"Create n8n workflow for delay prediction:
1. Schedule: Run daily
2. Fetch materials with upcoming deliveries
3. Analyze patterns:
   - Supplier's past delays
   - Material type typical lead time
   - Current status (PO released? Payment done?)
4. Claude API: 'Based on this data, predict likelihood of delay'
5. If high risk: Create alert in dashboard
6. Send proactive notification

Provide workflow JSON and prediction prompt."
```

#### Step 5.4: Invoice Reconciliation ⏳
**What to ask Claude:**
```
"Create workflow for payment validation:
1. Trigger: New invoice PDF uploaded
2. Extract: Invoice amount, PO number, date
3. Query dashboard API for matching PO
4. Compare amounts:
   - If match: Suggest payment update
   - If mismatch: Flag discrepancy with details
5. POST suggestion with explanation

Provide workflow and validation logic."
```

#### Step 5.5: Export Functionality ⏳
**What to ask Claude:**
```
"Create export functionality:
1. Excel export for all data tables
2. PDF reports for weekly/monthly summaries
3. Custom report builder
4. Email scheduled reports

Use libraries:
- openpyxl (Excel)
- reportlab or WeasyPrint (PDF)
- pandas (data processing)

Add export buttons to each page with format options."
```

**⏳ Deliverable:** Complete system with predictive features and analytics
**Status:** 0% - Next phase to implement
