# LPO Page Creation - Matching Dashboard Design ✅

## 🎨 What We Fixed

You were absolutely right! The chat.html page had a completely different design that didn't match your dashboard at all. Here's what we did:

### ❌ Old Problem:
- LPO functionality was embedded in `/chat` page
- Used different color scheme (purple/blue gradients)
- Didn't follow PKP branding
- Mixed with AI chat interface

### ✅ New Solution:
- **Dedicated `/lpo` page** matching your dashboard design
- **PKP brand colors**: Green (#006837) and Gold (#D4AF37)
- **Same table style** as materials/purchase_orders pages
- **Same modal style** as existing pages
- **Same filters** layout
- **Same navigation** integration
