## ⚙️ IMPLEMENTED BUT NEEDS CONFIGURATION

### 1. AI Integration (Need API Keys)
**Status:** Code is ready, but needs API credentials

**Required Actions:**
```bash
# Edit .env file and add:
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_claude_api_key_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

**How to Get API Keys:**
- **Claude API**: https://console.anthropic.com/
- **OpenAI API**: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys

**Cost Estimate:**
- Claude: ~$0.008 per document extraction
- OpenAI: ~$0.006 per document extraction

### 2. n8n Integration (Ready for Setup)
**Status:** Code is ready, n8n can call our APIs

**Required Actions:**
1. Install n8n: `npm install -g n8n`
2. Start n8n: `n8n start`
3. Create workflows to:
   - Monitor email attachments (POs, invoices, delivery notes)
   - Call `/api/ai_suggestions` with document data
   - Send notifications

**Sample n8n Workflow:**
```
Email Trigger → Extract Attachment → HTTP Request (POST /api/ai_suggestions) → Success/Error Handler
```

### 3. Database Migration to Production
**Status:** Currently using SQLite (development)

**For Production, Consider:**
- PostgreSQL (recommended)
- MySQL
- SQL Server

**Migration Steps:**
```python
# Update config.py:
SQLALCHEMY_DATABASE_URI = 'postgresql://user:pass@localhost/dbname'
```
