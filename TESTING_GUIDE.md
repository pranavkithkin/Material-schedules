```
Scenario: PO-001 has balance due
1. View PO-001 details
2. Check payment history: 40% paid (AED 18,000)
3. Check delivery date: Approaching
4. Expected: System should flag balance due
5. Message: "Balance AED 27,000 due before delivery"
```

### Test Material Revision Workflow
```
Scenario: Create resubmission
1. Material "PVC Conduits Rev 0" marked "Revise & Resubmit"
2. Create new material: Same type
3. Set Revision Number: 1
4. Set Previous Submittal: Select Rev 0
5. Result: Rev 1 linked to Rev 0 for audit trail
```

### Test Partial Delivery with Progress
```
Scenario: Track partial delivery visually
1. First delivery: 65% of items
2. System shows: ████████░░ 65%
3. Second delivery: Remaining 35%
4. System updates: ██████████ 100%
5. Status changes: Partial → Delivered
