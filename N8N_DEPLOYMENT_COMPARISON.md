# 🤔 n8n Deployment Strategy - Which Approach?

## Two Deployment Options

### Option 1: n8n Standalone (Separate Server) ⭐ RECOMMENDED
Deploy n8n on its own dedicated GCP server

### Option 2: n8n with Dashboard (Same Server)
Deploy n8n alongside Material Dashboard on one server

## 💡 Recommendation: Standalone n8n

### Why Standalone is Better:

1. **Isolation** 🛡️
   - If dashboard crashes, n8n keeps running
   - If n8n has issues, dashboard unaffected
   - Easier troubleshooting

2. **Scalability** 📈
   - Scale n8n independently when workflows grow
   - Scale dashboard independently when traffic grows
   - No resource conflicts

3. **Maintenance** 🔧
   - Update n8n without affecting dashboard
   - Restart n8n without dashboard downtime
   - Separate SSL certificates

4. **Multiple Projects** 🎯
   - One n8n can serve multiple dashboards
   - Connect future projects to same n8n
   - Reusable workflows across projects

5. **Cost-Effective for Growth** 💰
   - Start with e2-small for n8n ($13/month)
   - Upgrade only what you need
   - Dashboard stays on optimal size

## 🎯 Your Situation

Based on your setup:

### Current State:
- ✅ n8n on local machine (localhost + Cloudflare tunnel)
- ✅ Want n8n accessible 24/7
- ✅ Material Dashboard to deploy
- ✅ Planning multiple office projects

### Best Approach: **Two Separate Servers**

**Server 1: n8n Server (e2-small - $13/month)**
```
n8n-server (2 vCPU, 2GB RAM)
├── n8n Automation Platform
├── PostgreSQL (for n8n data)
└── Nginx + SSL
```
**Domain:** https://n8n.trart.uk

**Server 2: Dashboard Server (e2-medium - $25/month)**
```
dashboard-server (2 vCPU, 4GB RAM)
├── Material Delivery Dashboard
├── PostgreSQL (for dashboard data)
├── Future Project 1
├── Future Project 2
└── Nginx + SSL
```
**Domain:** https://dashboard.trart.uk (or your choice)

**Total Cost:** ~$38/month (after GCP trial)  
**GCP Trial:** Both FREE for 3 months!
